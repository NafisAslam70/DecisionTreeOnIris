# Iris Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict iris species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Introduction

This project utilizes the Iris dataset to train a Decision Tree Classifier for species classification. The Decision Tree Classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Code

The code provided in this repository includes:
- Loading the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
- Preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Building and training a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
- Evaluating the classifier's performance using accuracy metrics and classification reports.
- Visualizing the decision tree.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone <repository URL>`.
2. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib).
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code.
